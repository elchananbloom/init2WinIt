## Problem Statement

Context: There are many, many bank companies in the world. With these banks, you can deposit or withdrawal at their locations with ease, but what if someone wanted to deposit or withdrawal money without having to travel to the bank. What if someone needed a loan, but did not want to go to their location and go through their process of applying on paper?

Core Problem: Banking companies need to have a working system in order for users to add or withdrawal money and also need a loan system for these users in order to make it easier on them.

Impact on Users: It makes it less efficient on their clients to have to either go to the bank to do their business which can lead to a loss of clientele.

Opportunity for Solution: Creating an application in which a user can deposit and withdraw money and request/receive loans from the bank will make it easier on the customers of the bank and the bank owners themselves and can lead to more customers using their banking service.

## Technical Solution 

Overview of the Solution: We will build a web application that allows people to sign up for a bank and be able to make accounts to add or withdraw money into that bank. They can also request loans where the admin can deny or approve the loans. The admin can also see the statistics of the usersâ€™ transactions and see what accounts are in their system in order to manage it. They can also edit the categories that are in the system for the users to categorize their transactions.


Key Features and Functionalities:

Account Creation: Users can create banking accounts in order to withdraw and deposit into it. They can see their past payments in said accounts in their UI and pay their loans from their account. Admins will be able to delete these accounts if needed. 

Loan System: Users can request up to two loans and the admin can deny or approve these loans and can see all loans in the system.

Charts: Admin will be able to see charts of the statistics of everything in the system in order to see how their system is performing and how much is being put in and taken from them.

Categories: Admins will be able to add, edit, and delete the categories of the payments so that users can add more specific categories to their transactions if it is needed.



User Scenarios:

Scenario 1: Jay just got a new job and has a card with all of their money, but wants to be able to deposit it into their account. They go to the banking app, makes a new account and makes a deposit by putting in their card information into the system and depositing how much they made that week.
Scenario 2: Cee wants to buy a car, but does not have the funds for it, they request a loan of  $5000. The admin sees this, and sees that Cee does make a lot of deposits and also sees that the bank has a good amount of money due to the high bar charts of deposits. They then accept their request for a loan. Cee can then see that they have a loan and they need to pay back 5100 due to a fixed interest increase.

Frontend: React for building interactive UIs with dynamic features.
Backend: Spring Boot for creating a secure REST API to handle user authentication, account and loan management, category management, transactions, and data storage.
Database: MySQL to store user, transaction and account/loan data, including relationships between accounts and transactions, users and loans/accounts, etc.
Chart Integration: Charts.js or mui to be able to visualize the data in the system.
Payment Integration: Stripe api for the user to put in their payment info and pay
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure user login.

## Learning Goal 

Application: The team will use chart.js or mui to display reports of financial data that could be of use to the Admin.
Research and Resources: The team will start with the official chart.js documentation and a video tutorial on its useage in react.
Challenges: We anticipate needing to figure out how to properly pass data whose structure has changed in order to genreate reports. To address this, the team will practice with dummy data first and attempt to generate a variety of data visualizations.
Success Criteria: If Admins can different data visualizations after logging in the app, then I'll consider this learning goal achieved.
